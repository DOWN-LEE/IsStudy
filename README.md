## Planning reason and purpose
- Studying at school or reading room is burdensome because of the corona virus, so i provide an environment where users can easily study with others at home and count pure study time


## Main function
- Full-stack development with Typescript-based React and Nodejs
- I built sfu media server using open source mediasoup.
- Face detection using TensorflowJS, measuring pure study time by stopping the timer when not sitting in front of the camera
- Real-time study time ranking system implementation using Redis
- Containerized with Docker so that it can be easily deployed regardless of OS or environment
